# World-University-Rankings

Welcome to the World University Rankings!

Ranking universities is a challenging, political, and often contentious endeavor. With numerous national and international ranking systems, there's plenty of room for debate and disagreement. This dataset presents three prominent global university rankings from diverse sources.

**University Ranking Data:**
- **The Times Higher Education World University Ranking:** Widely recognized as one of the most influential measures, this ranking originated in the United Kingdom in 2010. However, it has faced criticism for commercialization and bias toward English-instructing institutions.
  
- **The Academic Ranking of World Universities (Shanghai Ranking):** Equally influential, this ranking was established in China in 2003. Criticisms include its emphasis on raw research power and perceived neglect of humanities and teaching quality.
  
- **The Center for World University Rankings:** A lesser-known ranking from Saudi Arabia, founded in 2012.

How do these rankings compare? Are the criticisms valid? And where does your alma mater stand in the global landscape?

**Supplementary Data:**
To enrich your analysis, we've included two supplementary datasets:
- **Educational Attainment Data:** Sourced from The World Data Bank, this dataset incorporates information from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and the Barro-Lee Dataset. Explore how national educational attainment correlates with the quality of universities.
  
- **Expenditure on Education:** Derived from the National Center for Education Statistics, this dataset measures public and private direct expenditure on education as a percentage of gross domestic product. Does higher spending on education translate to better international university rankings?
